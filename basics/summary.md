# Tying it all together :necktie:
##### :fire: Here we're going to spend some time tying together computers and programs :fire:

### How do computers and programs work together?
I know what you're thinking.
> I know what computers are, I know what programs are, but how on Earth
are they related?

It's no secret that your computer can't read English, so it's safe to assume that your computer can't read programming languages either.
> Wait what? I thought computers could read code? Those are the instructions I'm giving it, right?

Well, yes and no. Imagine this scenario:
```
There's a new restaurant in town called McProgram. When you order your food,
you also tell every employee at McProgram what to do in order to cook your
food just right; however, every employee at McProgram ONLY speaks German. 

In order to give the employees the proper instructions, you need
a translator, someone who can translate your language to German so
that the employees can interpret your instructions.
```

Computers work in this same way. In this example, you are the program and the employees of McProgram are the computer. When you write code, that code could be in _any_ programming language. It'd be crazy if your computer just magically understood all of the existing programming languages, right?

When you write code, you're writing it in a form that _humans_ can read. When you want to run your program, your code is _translated_ to machine code (binary) - code that the _**machine**_ (the computer) can read. Each programming language essentially comes with its own way of translating code into a form that a computer can read, so you don't have to worry much about that.

Basically, you're program goes from _**this**_:

To _**this**_, so that the computer can understand:

> Okay, I think that makes sense.

:thumbsup:

### Where do we go from here?
Now that you've got a solid understanding of how computers and programs work, it's time to learn how to program! From there, you'll learn how certain things work behind the scenes and how to optimize your code to be fast and well written. And how to make cool stuff. And solve cool problems. The possibilities are endless!

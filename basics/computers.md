### What are computers?
Let's take what you know about computers and break it down a little.

What all does a computer have?
* Input (keyboard, mouse)
* CPU
* RAM/Main Memory
* Hard Drive
* Operating System (OSX, Windows, Linux, etc.)
* Output (screen)
* Some other stuff that we won't go over here :v:

#### What's input?
The official definition of input is:

> What is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.

Think of input as the information that you give to your computer. This can be characters that you type with your keyboard, audio that you give with your mic, the positioning and clicking of your mouse, etc.

Without input from the user (you), a computer would just be a fancy screen.

```
Analogy: Think of McDonald's as the computer. The cashier is 
the keyboard, you are the user and your order is the input.
```

#### What's the CPU?
The CPU is what does the real work. It does all of the math and logic. It executes all of the instructions given to it.

```
Back to the McDonald's analogy: If the order is the input,
the CPU is what tells the cashier, fry cook and other employees
where to walk, what to do with the order and how to give the
customer their food when the order is complete. 

Note that this is all according to the instructions for each
employee. The CPU does not define the instructions for each
employee, the software does. The CPU just makes shit happen.
```

#### What's RAM?
RAM, also called _**main memory**_, stands for `Random Access Memory`, but you don't need to know that. Think of RAM as memory that goes away when the software is closed, or when the computer is shut down. It's temporary memory, unlike your hard drive, whose data sticks around even after the program is closed or the computer shuts down.

```
Example of main memory: Imagine your friend just told you
a secret. This secret is so important that you have to write
it down in your journal of secrets.

Your brain is main memory and your journal is your hard
drive. You might forget the secret the next day, but it will
always be in your journal until you take it out.
```

Just like your brain, main memory can only hold so much before it gets full.
Your journal (hard drive), however, can hold many more secrets without losing
any of the data in the long term.

#### What's a hard drive?

Your hard drive, also called _**disk**_, is what we call _**persistent storage**_. Let's take a step back, what does _**persistent**_ really mean? 

> Continuing to exist or endure over a prolonged period.

What about _**storage**_?

> The action or method of storing something for future use.

When we put these two together, we get something that stores things for a long
period of time (i.e. not temporarily, like main memory).

```
Hard drive analogy: Going back to the journal example, the journal
would be considered the hard drive. If we look at the McDonald's
example, the receipt book containing all previous orders would be
considered the hard drive.

The cashier may remember a few previous orders (i.e. in main memory),
but will probably forget the rest; however, the receipt book
is always there, and as soon as the orders are saved, they
are there to stay.
```

When you _**save**_ something in Microsoft Word, or Adobe Photoshop
or any other software, the data is saved to your _**hard drive**_.
The temporary data in the program before you hit save is in main
memory (RAM). But as you know, if you close the program without saving, your changes are gone :cry: because the memory was temporary.

#### What's an operating system?
In technical terms:

> The operating system is the software that manages the computer's resources.

The _**computer's resources**_ include memory, disk (hard drive), input, output, etc. 

You may know an operating system as your computer's graphical user interface, and in some ways that's correct; however, the operating system is much more than that.

The operating system is the layer of software that programs (apps)
and users (you) use to interact with key components of the computer. Without an operating system, it would be really hard to keep track of files and do other useful things!

```
Operating system analogy: Imagine you wanted to withdraw money
from your bank account. With an ATM, this is really easy. You
don't need any external knowledge, except for how to push
a few buttons and read a screen. 

The ATM does all of the hard, banking related work for you. You 
just interact with it. The ATM is the operating system in this scenario,
and you are a piece of software interacting with it. Had the
operating system not been there, your job would be much harder
and would require knowledge of complex banking concepts. The operating
system makes it easy for you to not have to worry about any hardware related
details.
```

In this example, the ATM _**abstracts**_ the banking logic _**away**_ from the user, so that the user does not have to worry about it. More on abstractions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)).


```
Another operating system analogy: A simpler example would be
if you were at a restaurant like Chipotle, where you tell the
employee what you would like in your meal. The employee does
the hard work for you, interacting with the ingredients and machines,
you just tell them what you want them to do. The employee
is the operating system and you are the software interacting
with it.
```

**TL;DR**, the operating system provides an easy to use interface for you to interact with core components of your computer.

#### What's output?
Output includes exactly what you may think - the display, speakers, etc. Output is what a piece of software puts out. For example, a piano app may play sounds when you press a key. A calculator app may display numbers in the screen portion so that you can see what math you are doing. Output of a program includes output to the screen (something you can see), the speakers (something you can hear), vibrations (on mobile devices), etc.

```
Output analogy: In reference to the McDonald's example, the
output would be the meal produced by the staff and given
to the customer.
```

### What are programs?
Think of a program as some code or software that you can run. When you _write a program_, you're writing code that you will eventually want to run or use. All applications on your computer and phone can be thought of as _**programs**_, or _**software**_. They basically mean the same thing. Your operating system could even be considered a program (a very large one).

### Difference between programs and code?
_**Code**_ is what you _write_. A _**program**_ contains code and can be run/used.

```
Analogy: Imagine you're writing an essay in Microsoft Word. The words
you write would be the code, and the essay itself is the program.
```

### What all does a program contain?
A program primarily contains code, written in some _**programming language**_ of your choice. Programs can contain other things like images, videos and sound files, depending on what kind of software you're writing.

### What's the point?
The point is that computers don't do anything without something telling them what to do (i.e. a program). A program does nothing more than take in some input (i.e. from the keyboard/mouse), do some computation with the input, and spit out some results in some way that the user finds useful.

Below are some examples of programs, their input and output.

| Program Type  |  Input  | Output |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Text editor  | Words from keyboard  | Formats text, checks spelling |
|  Video game | Key presses and mouse clicks  | Moves character on screen  |
| Web browser  | HTML | Converts HTML to graphics and text |
| Music player | Mouse/finger presses | Plays song audio |

Writing programs is about _problem solving_. A program gives the computer a specific set of instructions (your code) to solve a problem, and the computer executes it (runs your program). Easy! :sunglasses:

### Seems simple, why is this hard?
It's not hard! However, programming can be time consuming and requires a strong understanding of certain concepts. The goal of a program is to solve a problem, but to solve a _big problem_ you must solve a bunch of _smaller_ problems which add up to the _big problem_. Let me give you an example.

Let's say you're building a game. You might come across the following problems:
* Determine how far to move the player on the screen when the arrow keys are pressed
* Detect whether or not the player has bumped into a wall
* Make sure the player isn't doing any illegal moves
* Display the graphics properly
* Make a certain sound when a player shoots their gun

As mentioned above, programming isn't particuarly hard. It requires a solid understanding of how things work and the ability to break a problem down into simpler problems that can be easily solved. If you can give instructions to your friend to get to your house, you can give instructions to a computer to solve some cool problems. :v:
